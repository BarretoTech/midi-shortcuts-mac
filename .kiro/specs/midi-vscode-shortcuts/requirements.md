# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This VSCode extension enables users to map MIDI controller inputs to VSCode commands and shortcuts, allowing for tactile control of development workflows through physical MIDI devices like keyboards, pad controllers, or control surfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect my MIDI controller to trigger VSCode commands, so that I can have tactile control over my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a MIDI device is connected to the system THEN the extension SHALL detect and list available MIDI devices
2. WHEN a user selects a MIDI device THEN the extension SHALL establish a connection to that device
3. WHEN the MIDI device sends input THEN the extension SHALL receive and process the MIDI messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to map specific MIDI keys/controls to VSCode commands, so that I can customize my workflow based on my preferred MIDI controller layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses a MIDI key/control THEN the extension SHALL capture the MIDI note/CC number
2. WHEN a user assigns a VSCode command to a MIDI input THEN the extension SHALL store this mapping in VSCode settings
3. WHEN a user wants to modify an existing mapping THEN the extension SHALL allow editing of the command assignment
4. WHEN a user wants to remove a mapping THEN the extension SHALL delete the assignment and stop responding to that MIDI input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to trigger the correct VSCode commands when I press mapped MIDI keys, so that I can control VSCode without using my keyboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mapped MIDI key is pressed THEN the extension SHALL execute the corresponding VSCode command
2. WHEN VSCode is not the active application THEN the extension SHALL still respond to MIDI input (since it runs within VSCode)
3. WHEN a MIDI key is held down THEN the extension SHALL handle key repeat appropriately (either single trigger or repeat based on command type)
4. WHEN a command execution fails THEN the extension SHALL log the error and continue operating

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple interface to configure my MIDI mappings, so that I can easily set up and modify my controller without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN it SHALL provide commands in the command palette for configuration
2. WHEN a user wants to create a new mapping THEN the extension SHALL guide them through MIDI input detection and command assignment
3. WHEN a user views their mappings THEN the extension SHALL display all current MIDI-to-command assignments in a webview or quick pick
4. WHEN a user tests a mapping THEN the extension SHALL provide feedback showing the MIDI input received and command triggered

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to run seamlessly in the background, so that my MIDI controller works without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VSCode is running THEN the extension SHALL operate automatically without requiring constant user attention
2. WHEN VSCode starts THEN the extension SHALL activate and restore MIDI connections automatically
3. WHEN the extension encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error and continue operating when possible
4. WHEN the user wants to disable the extension THEN VSCode's extension management SHALL provide standard disable/uninstall options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my MIDI mappings to persist between sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure my controller every time I restart VSCode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or modifies mappings THEN the extension SHALL save the configuration to VSCode workspace or user settings
2. WHEN VSCode starts THEN the extension SHALL load previously saved mappings automatically
3. WHEN a user wants to backup their configuration THEN the extension SHALL provide export functionality through commands
4. WHEN a user wants to restore a configuration THEN the extension SHALL provide import functionality through commands

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to map MIDI inputs to any available VSCode command, so that I can control all aspects of my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user assigns a command to MIDI input THEN the extension SHALL support any command available in VSCode's command palette
2. WHEN a user searches for commands THEN the extension SHALL provide a searchable list of available commands
3. WHEN a user maps built-in VSCode commands THEN the extension SHALL execute them correctly
4. WHEN a user maps commands from other extensions THEN the extension SHALL execute them if the target extension is installed and active
